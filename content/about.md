# About Me
Hi, my name is Jatin Pandey, I am a first year student of Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) course in Mechanical Engineering at [Army Institute of Pune](https://aitpune.com). I am 18, about to be 19 in a few months and I made this site so that I can have my thoughts and ideas accessible all over the world, at any time.

# About this site
I took this [hugo](https://gohugo.io) theme from a Programmer named [Radek](https://github.com/panr). After adding it as a submodule, I made a few edits here and there, made a config file. After all of it was done, I added an "ABOUT ME" post and a few more in about an hour.

After all of it was done, I pushed this website to my Github repository. After that, I made an account on [Netlify](https://netlify.com). Ta-da, the site was up and running, with all the technicalities taken care of. Now that I had an up and running site, I thought what could I add more to make it look like a real website.
So I came up with the idea of getting a cheap domain, but since this is my first time making a site, and I did not want to waste my money, I bought a free .tk domain from [Freenom](https://freenom.com). I pointed the nameservers to Netlify's DNS and made sure to get a free Let's Encrypt SSL certificate.

So all in all, I spent a couple of odd hours, some keystrokes and literally zero money to get my personal site on the World Wide Web. I hope you like this website and pay a visit to Radek's. Great guy, kudos to him.

# Future of this site
This site is more of an experimental one than a useful one, I do not wish to make this my lifetime personal site. I'll tinker with the theme, and very soon I am thinking of making my own theme with SASS and React, till then, I think this will suffice.
Thanks for reading.
